title: Day 23 - Coprocessor Conflagration
day: 23
year: 2017
---

Another CPU type problem. I took the react app I wrong for <a href="{{ "/2016/day/23.html" | relative_url }}">Day 23, 2016</a>, retooled it for this "Device," and went to analyzing the program for part two.

Part one is straight forward, it runs quickly.

Part two, however, would require some tricks to see _what_ the program was actually doing.

Looking at the input, and drawing lines between the jumps, our program looks like this:

```
 0.  set b 67
 1.  set c b
 2.  jnz a 2 ->----+
 3.  jnz 1 5 -->---P---->-+
 4.  mul b 100 <---+      |
 5.  sub b -100000        Q
 6.  set c b              |
 7.  sub c -17000         |
 8.  set f 1  <---------+-+
 9.  set d 2            ^
10.  set e 2  <-------+ |
11.  set g d  <-----+ | |
12.  mul g e        | | |
13.  sub g b        | | |
14.  jnz g 2 ->-+   | | |
15.  set f 0    A   X | |
16.  sub e -1 <-+   | | |
17.  set g e        | Y |
18.  sub g b        | | |
19.  jnz g -8 ->----+ | Z
20.  sub d -1         | |
21.  set g d          | |
22.  sub g b          | |
23.  jnz g -13 ->-----+ |
24.  jnz f 2 ->-+       |
25.  sub h -1   B       |
26.  set g b  <-+       |
27.  sub g c            |
28.  jnz g 2 ->---+     |
29.  jnz 1 3      C     |
30.  sub b -17 <--+     |
31.  jnz 1 -23 ->-------+
```

`P` and `Q` are the paths that happen when you flip `a` to 1 in part two. They are relatively straight-forward:

1. In part one, `b` and `c` get set to **67**, and we go to instruction 8, the start of the main `Z` loop.
2. In part two, `b` gets set to **106700**, and `c` gets set to _106700_ + _17000_ = **123700** and also start on instruction 8.

As it moves toward the `X` inner loop (this one gets hit a lot), it sets `f` to **1**, and initializes `d` and `e` to **2**.

Next, starting on instruction 11, this `X` loop essentially:

1. Checks if `d` * `e` is equal to the value in `b`. If so, it doesn't skip the `A` jump, and importantly changes `f` from **1** to **0**.
2. Keeps incrementing `e` by one until it reaches the value in `b`.

Once we break out of the `X` loop onto instruction 20, we then

1. Increment `d` by one.
2. Check if `d` is equal to `b`. If so continue on. Otherwise, loop back up through `Y`.
3. `Y` is the same as the start as `X`, except it resets `e` back to **2**.

This keeps happening until we multiply every number between 2 and `b`, ending with `d` and `e` being equal to `b`. That then breaks us out of the `Y` loop.

Once there, we

1. Check if `f` is equal to **0**. If so, add **1** to register `h`. Otherwise, its jumps through `B` to skip this.

Now we are on instruction 26.

1. We check to see if `b` is equal to `c`. If so, exit the program.
2. Otherwise, add **17** to `b` and loop back through `Z` to start the whole thing over again!

So, what this program does is...

_Looks for prime numbers!_

Specifically, _starting at **106700**, in increments of **17**, check how many numbers are not prime for 1000 iterations, inclusively_.

In JS that might look like:

```js
// Simple prime number checker.
function isPrime(num) {
    if (num === 2) {
        return true;
    }

    let s = Math.sqrt(num);
    for (let i = 2; i <= s; i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
          return false; 
        }
    }

    return true;
}

function run() {
    let count = 0;
    let start = 106700;
    let increment = 17;

    // Importantly, our loop is _inclusive_, so use `<=` comparison.
    for (let n = start; n <= (start + 1000 * increment); n += increment) {
        if (!isPrime(n)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

run();
```

Running the above, gives us our answer: **`905`**!

For the application, it works the same way. I'll copy in the instructions I originally wrote:

> To run this yourself, the application works as follows:
> 
> When the app starts, you'll need to initialize it with your program. Paste in your program's input and submit to start the program. It defaults to the input I received.
> 
> Press the play button (â–¶) to run the program until the break point. If no point is set, it'll run until the program finishes. The steps under the play button step forward 1, 10, and 100 ticks, respectively. 
> 
> The break point can be any expression that'll be `eval`'d. Use `a`, `b`, `c`, ... `h` variables for the registers, and `i` for the instruction. For instance, to run until the program is at instruction 22, just enter `i === 22` into the breakpoint. To run until it is at instruction 16 _and_ register `g` is greater than to 10, then you'd have `i === 16 && g > 10`.
> 
> At the top, you can change any register to any value, change what instruction the program is at by typing in `i`, and can even change arbitrary lines by typing in `l`. Once you type in the action, press **set** to save the change.
> 
> For instance, for part two, I had to change register `a` to `1`.
> 
> As always, code is untranspiled: modern browsers only.

    <summary>Day 23, Part 1 Description</summary>

    <h2>--- Day 23: Coprocessor Conflagration ---</h2><p>You decide to head directly to the CPU and fix the printer from there. As you get close, you find an <em>experimental coprocessor</em> doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire">halt and catch fire</a>. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.</p>
<p>The code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/18">tablet</a>. The general functionality seems <em>very similar</em>, but some of the instructions are different:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set X Y</code> <em>sets</em> register <code>X</code> to the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
<li><code>sub X Y</code> <em>decreases</em> register <code>X</code> by the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
<li><code>mul X Y</code> sets register <code>X</code> to the result of <em>multiplying</em> the value contained in register <code>X</code> by the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
<li><code>jnz X Y</code> <em>jumps</em> with an offset of the value of <code>Y</code>, but only if the value of <code>X</code> is <em>not zero</em>. (An offset of <code>2</code> skips the next instruction, an offset of <code>-1</code> jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)</li>
<p>Only the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here, named <code>a</code> through <code>h</code>, all start at <code>0</code>.</p>
</ul>
<p>The coprocessor is currently set to some kind of <em>debug mode</em>, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.</p>
<p>If you run the program (your puzzle input), <em>how many times is the <code>mul</code> instruction invoked?</em></p>

    <summary>Day 23, Part 2 Description</summary>
<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Now, it's time to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The <em>debug mode switch</em> is wired directly to register <code>a</code>.  You <span title="From 'magic' to 'more magic'.">flip the switch</span>, which makes <em>register <code>a</code> now start at <code>1</code></em> when the program is executed.</p>
<p>Immediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat.  Whoever wrote this program obviously didn't choose a very efficient implementation.  You'll need to <em>optimize the program</em> if it has any hope of completing before Santa needs that printer working.</p>
<p>The coprocessor's ultimate goal is to determine the final value left in register <code>h</code> once the program completes. Technically, if it had that... it wouldn't even need to run the program.</p>
<p>After setting register <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>, if the program were to run to completion, <em>what value would be left in register <code>h</code>?</em></p>
</details>

#### Answer to Part Two
