 * OK, had to look up a hint for this one. Basically,
 * it'd take forever to actually run 50 billion iterations
 * (especially since as the simulation ticks forward, our "row"
 * continue to grow, so our inner loop gets longer and longer!!!),
 * so the trick is that the sum (at some point) "stabalizes,"
 * meaning with each tick we add some constant value.
 *
 * So, we just need to simulate until we stablize, see how much
 * the next iteration will bring, and multiply that by the days remaining
 * and add that to the current sum.
 *
 * Simple! ðŸ™„
